# symmetric-Lagrangian-origami

This Mathematica notebook derives analytical solutions for symmetric origami kinematics, verifies their correctness through the loop closure constraint, and includes checks for self contact.

This is not meant as software package, but instead as the source of the data generated for the paper titled "Lagrangian approach to origami vertex analysis: Kinematics".
